    <pre>
  I sit in a humming hospital waiting lobby
  where next to me a thirsty fern begs for
  attention from the elephant-brooched
  receptionist trying his hardest to pretend
  like it doesn't exist.

  I sit invisibly in the fourth stale blue
  chair in a conjoined series of five, which
  I have seen in every public building in
  America, eagerly awaiting news of my
  poisoned mother.

  hanging above her head, above
  San Francisco, above America
  the inexorable clock’s minute hand
  closes in on an irreversible nuclear
  midnight.

  matricidal venom flows unimpeded
  through her veins, old as the Nile
  doomed as the Amazon— the anthropogenic
  snake bites on her neck neglected
  in favor of intravenous half-measures
  and apologies from white-haired doctors
  promising they have exhausted all
  avenues of care but continue to monitor
  her condition hoping it will reject
  science and miraculously improve.

  doctors and nurses make busy around
  my mother’s imminent corpse checking
  blood pressure and measuring molecules—
  my tools are not so precise yet even I can
  gauge her wilting face and skeleton hands
  and know there is no hope.

    <h2>Foray into Absurdity</h2>
    <pre>
  Between the swollen clouds of the forgotten heavens
  And the silent vacuum of a cold-race’s cosmic finish line
  Leagues above the melting earth, poisoned by 100
  Injections of absolute power and unregulated corruption
  White men in black suits play with god.
  Here, a new bird flies.
  Its intercontinental migrations threaten all too important
  corporate losses, human cost of lives be damned.
  It's all about the benjamins.
  Its wingless promise induces contractions of illegal wars
  and crimes against humanity and 10 trillion dollars since
  2001.
  This false bird, unholy machination manufactured solely to justify
  red white and blue imperialism. It laughs at the graceful dove
  yet it too is prisoner in a man-made cage. It too yearns for
  release.
  In the blood-coated hands of the tree-hungry sex-hungry
  delegate-hungry economic sanction-hungry tax-haven-hungry
  Is the key to extinction. We know their names and they have
  bought ours. Corporate malfeasance dances on mass graves
  dug by survivors of military interventions.
  Like a parrot, this bird mimics human sounds, yet it does so
  only on in its death scream.
  The sirens of war will ring once more.
  Only a fool would doubt it.
  Millions, noseblind to the scent of fascism,
   will turn their apathetic heads and shrug
  when American eagles plunge the world of man
  Into a radioactive winter.

    <h2>Plutocrat</h2>
    <pre>
  Down in the military rows
  Of toothy thicket and blackberry bush
  Saturated with plump globes
  Childish giggles and a wicker basket
  Made me feel rural.
  Greedily I grabbed and grabbed
  And plucked the more. Fingers
  Tepidly searching, breaching thorny
  Fortress feeling, pinching, tugging
  Ripe fruit.
  I brought garden shears to cut away
  The verdant vine and wicked thorn
  Which labored so diligently to protect
  My bounty.
  I wanted to pick the most berries.
  I wouldn't even eat them all.

    <h2>Lovely Tree, Forlorn Tree</h2>
<pre>
  tucked inside a hollowed out tree,
  enveloped by verdant twigs and trunk
  and walls thick with deformed rings,
  I press fateful head and calloused toes
  to dirt padded by eons of solitude.

  I am stuck in this hollowed out tree.
  no visitors grace the forbidden garden.
  no jailors haunt my sylvan prison.
  I see the shade of the California Grizzly.
  I see my beating heart, fibrous0
  and embossed like the towering redwood
  whom is both my complacent landlord
  and my patient, stalwart gallows.

  illusions of timid hummingbirds,
  tweeting and tapping against their
  complicit, silver cages,
  fat-cheeked Chipmunks stuffed on pilfered acorns,
  and treacherous geese, pearly feathers
  unstained by deceitful honking misunderstand
  these untended grounds as shut to their merriment.

  the bulbous roots of this giant stretch
  from Singapore to Ann Arbor
  its withered canopy grasps hungrily
  toward the taunting sun.
  this tree remembers a future warmed
  by a star’s kiss of hope.

  life inside this hollowed out tree
  is unbearably bearable—
  like a restless, sleepless night
  and I am an insomniac.
  my hollow is a fruitless tree—
  it is a grand joke, a comedy
  my hollow is a cold and bitter soup
  it is a drought, a forgotten home,
  and a child swallowed by the sea.
  it is a forest fire in Los Angeles.
  it is a father’s suicide in San Francisco.
  it is a young boy with leukemia—
  whose parents’ savings are less than zero—
  my hollow is cosmic, and a grand joke.

    <h2>Another Lament</h2>
    <pre>
  Everyone I know feels lost at sea.
  I see my friends, my brothers and sisters,
  Joke each day about how they want to die.
  Participating in our own lives like watching
  Paint dry, waiting for anything to distract us
  From our empty rooms and crowded phones.
  I hear them say “One day I will be happy,”
  Then draw their heavy burgundy curtains and
  Roll over just to past the time and return to sleep.
  The hollow, melatonin-driven dreams filled
  with nightmares are still preferable
  To the manufactured depression of wakefulness.
  I’m bored.


  Everyone I know feels like a lopsided
  Skipping stone shot out of an American tank
  Into choppy waters polluted and corrupt
  From internal investigation, hungry to swallow
  Them whole.

  Everyone I know feels lost at sea.
  My friends, my brothers and sisters,
  Chose not to see the American monster
  Dripping red, dosing out depression,
  And dangling disney movies and instagram
  Celebrities and twitter and scandal, six
  Minutes of ads and intercontinental
  Ballistic missiles in our dark-ringed faces.
  And we chose to believe this is enough,
  our consent manufactured, so desperate
  For a reason to stop joking about
  How much we want to die.

    <h2>Golden Gates</h2>
    <pre>
  I remember a midnight in San Francisco
  I remember skin salted by bay breeze and spray
  I remember the blurry opaque night sky
  black as the hungry waters two-hundred feet
  below my dangling legs. Sneakers double knotted
  praying for the stars shielded by a million’s light
  pollution would reveal the universe’s close-held
  secrets and unknowable truths and fiery cataclysm.
  I see myself through the wrong side of a telescope
  and sit upon a red bronze threshold, wonder of the
  world, seated high above the maw I feel full.

  still, solemnly, I am tugged down.
  not by cosmic force or financial doom but
  by the festered tumor of regret and sin
  planted deep in the wilted husk of eden
  that is my home and my soul and my pernicious
  prison. Gated and exiled from love and hope
  I am subject to the rot of decay.

  When will the water rise?
  I see homes swallowed by the externalities
  feudal labor like the externalities of the
  subjugation of the hollow men and dying earth.
  I am tugged down.
  laughing at the absurdity of struggle.
  This is a facade.
  plumitting, racing
  I should have learnt to fly.
